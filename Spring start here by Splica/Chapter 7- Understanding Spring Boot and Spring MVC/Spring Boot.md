- What is benefit of using Spring Boot?
1- Simplified project creation—You can use a project initialization service to get an empty but configured skeleton app. 

 2- Dependency starters—Spring Boot groups certain dependencies used for a specific purpose with dependency starters. You don’t need to figure out all the must-have dependencies you need to add to your project for one particular purpose nor which versions you should use for compatibility. 
3-  Autoconfiguration based on dependencies—Based on the dependencies you added to your project, Spring Boot defines some default configurations. Instead of writing all the configurations yourself, you only need to change the ones provided by Spring Boot that don’t match what you need. Changing the configs likely requires less code (if any).
