- A template engine is a dependency that provides your app with the capability to easily get the data the controller sends and display it on the view like Thymleaf.
- The client can send data to the server through request parameters or path variables. A controllerâ€™s action gets the details the client sends in parameters annotated with @RequestParam or @PathVariable.
- A request parameter can be optional. 
- You should only use path variables for mandatory data the client sends.
